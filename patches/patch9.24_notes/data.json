  "note": "Hello friends! It's the last patch of the year! As with most patches following a huge shakedown like Preseason, we have a lot of changes and tweaks in this patch after assessing some of the initial data and your general feedback. We've also already adjusted the knobs on the some of the new drakes, monsters, and pacing components of the game in 9.23 that we're including again here in case you missed it. And while this is technically the last patch of the year, you may see an end-of-year \"9.24b\" balance patch (a patch with no skins or features) based off of how the game is in a couple of weeks. There'll be a separate set of patch notes for that, so keep an eye out! Before we go, make sure to hold on to your poison because everyone's new favorite edgy boy (and his sister), Aphelios joins the Rift in 9.24! Following her Lunari brethren's release, Diana is also getting an overhaul to her kit, VFX, SFX, and ability icons to exude more of the moonly glow of her people. Last, but not least, Poro King is back for a limited time! Get your snowballs ready for more fun with everyone's favorite royal fluffball. Take this portal if you're looking for TFT's patch notes!",

As promised, we've made some changes aimed at helping Diana’s pre-level-6 lane, and making both the playing as and against Diana experiences less of a feast or famine. By giving her access to Lunar Rush as a basic ability, we're unlocking one of Diana's core mechanics earlier and in the laning phase, allowing her to fight against and interact with enemies before she hits level 6. The change also allows her to effectively gank early as a jungler too, which is a massive increase to her effectiveness in that role.\n                    \n                    Additionally, Diana's new ultimate now significantly opens her up to more options as the game progresses, giving her both teamfight and skirmish capabilities that were previously inaccessible to her. This also adds a lot of variety to how she approaches fights, so her goal isn't always to nuke a single person with a full combo.\n                    \n                    Overall, the goal of these changes was to preserve what people loved about Diana while giving her both the tools and the variety that champions should have. We want Diana players to be comfortable with what they already know, but with a kit that may be more fun and rewarding for new Diana players as well.",
